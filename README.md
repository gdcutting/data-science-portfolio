# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repo (currently Work In Progress [WIP]) will contain various data science and machine-learning related projects.

## Contents

- [numpy-exec-profiling](numpy-exec-profiling/) - a Jupyter notebook which does some performance profiling to compare the *dramatic* performance increase gained by using the numpy built-in array type. This notebook is self-explanatory. You can also view the [**gist version**](https://gist.github.com/gdcutting/64bbd7fb94844956986f8692b13fc21b).
- [lorenz-attractor](lorenz-attractor/) - a notebook demonstrating the intricate behavior of the Lorenz attractor, a mathematical system frequently studied in systems and chaos theory. [**Gist version**](https://gist.github.com/gdcutting/805eb70cf9ef6f8b862d792a5e604cbb).
- [flight_routes](flight_routes/) - a notebook which uses airport and route data to calculate and visualize the twenty most trafficked airports in the US. Uses Pandas to do some JOINing and aggregation, and plotly for visualization.
- [spam_naive_bayes](spam_naive_bayes/) - a .py which uses a Naive Bayes classifier to analyze data from the Spambase spam dataset.
