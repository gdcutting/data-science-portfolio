# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repo (currently Work In Progress [WIP]) will contain various machine-learning related projects.

## Contents

- [numpy-exec-profiling](numpy-exec-profiling/) - a Jupyter notebook which does some performance profiling to compare the *dramatic* performance increase gained by using the numpy built-in array type. This notebook is self-explanatory. You can also view the [**gist version**](https://gist.github.com/gdcutting/64bbd7fb94844956986f8692b13fc21b).
- [lorenz-attractor](lorenz-attractor/) - a notebook demonstrating the intricate behavior of the Lorenz attractor, a mathematical system frequently studied in systems and chaos theory. [**Gist version**](https://gist.github.com/gdcutting/c37935fce8a09c6c88b6342dba1adf68).
