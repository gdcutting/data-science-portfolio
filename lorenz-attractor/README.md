# Lorenz Attractor Demonstration

This notebook uses a variety of approaches to demonstrate the behavior of the Lorenz System, a dynamic system defined by a coupled system of differential equations which is commonly studied in Systems Science and chaos theory. Under certain choices of parameters, the system exhibits attractor behavior - an [attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor) "is a set of states toward which a system tends to evolve,[2] for a wide variety of starting conditions of the system. System values that get close enough to the attractor values remain close even if slightly disturbed."

I experiment with a variety of approaches to implementing the Lorenz system and exploring its behavior. One version uses numpy alone without a dedicated package for performing the necessary integration calculations; another uses [**odeint**] from the Scipy library, which simplifies the code and makes it easier to use alternative numerical integration methods like [Runge-Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods). I also experiment with different combinations of values for the Lorenz equation parameters (ρ, σ, and β) and explore the various regimes of behavior that these can produce.
